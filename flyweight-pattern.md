## The Flyweight Pattern:
* The pattern aims to minimize the use of memory in an application by sharing as much data as possible with related objects (e.g. application configuration, state and so on).

* In practice, Flyweight data sharing can involve taking several similar objects or data constructs used by a number of objects and placing this data into a single external object. We can pass through this object to those depending on this data, rather than storing identical data across each one.
