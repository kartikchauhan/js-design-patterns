### Categories of Design Pattern:

#### Creational Design Patterns:
* Creational design patterns focus on handling object creation mechanisms where objects are created in a manner suitable for the situation we're working in. The basic approach to object creation might otherwise lead to added complexity in a project whilst these patterns aim to solve this problem by controlling the creation process.

* Some of the patterns that fall under this category are: *Constructor*, *Factory*, *Abstract*, *Prototype*, *Singleton* and *Builder*.

#### Structural Design Patterns:
* Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects.

* They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn't need to do the same.

* They also assist in recasting parts of the system which don't fit a particular purpose into those that do.

* Patterns that fall under this category include: *Decorator*, *Facade*, *Flyweight*, *Adapter* and *Proxy*.

#### Behavioral Design Patterns:
* Behavioral patterns focus on improving or streamlining the communication between disparate objects in a system.

* Some behavioral patterns include: *Iterator*, *Mediator*, *Observer* and *Visitor*.
